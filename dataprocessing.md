# Data Processing Implementation
## Initial Planning
### Process
- Create an image repository in GitHub.
- When there are changes in the Image Repository, only the modified files will be uploaded to the S3 Bucket, handled through GitHub Action.
- Upon an upload event to the S3 Bucket, the files will be stored under the `images/` prefix.
- Raw images will be stored in the `raw` directory.
- When stored, an event trigger will occur.
- The event trigger will execute a Lambda function, and the Lambda function will generate three additional resolution-specific files, which will then be uploaded to the S3 Bucket and recorded in DynamoDB.
- The resolution-specific files will be stored in the `sg`, `md`, and `lg` directories with the same filename.
- Uploaded files will have a unique filename in the format `YYMMDDHHMISS-8digit`, where the 8-digit value is a hash generated by a hash function.

### Github Action
- Executed when a Push event occurs on the main branch.
- Prevents Push for non-image files by adding an event trigger.
- If no issues are detected, the action executes a command to upload only the modified files to the S3 Bucket.
- Example code
```
name: Restrict Non-Image Files on Push

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  check-files:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Check if only image files were pushed
      run: |
        # Define the file extensions considered as images
        IMAGE_FILES=$(git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD | grep -E '\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|svg)$')

        # If there are no image files, fail the job
        if [ -z "$IMAGE_FILES" ]; then
          echo "No image files were pushed. Failing the job."
          exit 1
        fi

    - name: Success Message
      run: echo "Only image files were pushed, proceeding with the workflow."
```

### DynamoDB
- As it is NoSQL, no predefined schema is required. The following defines the key values
- `ImageId`: Managed as the primary key in the format `{S3Filename}_{FileType}`.
- `RegisteredFile`: The location and filename as registered in the GitHub repository.
- `UploadDate`: Date of registration.
- `StoredKey`: Key where the file is stored in the S3 Bucket.
- `ImageType`: One of `raw/sg/md/lg`.
- `ImageSize`: The size of the image.
- `Resolution`: The image resolution.
- `Status`: One of `failed/pending/completed`.
- `ErrorMessage`: A field added only in case of an error, recording the error message.

### Lambda Function
- Triggered by an S3 event.
- Inserts the original image information into DynamoDB.
- Converts the image into different resolutions and stores them in the S3 Bucket.
- Inserts the information of the original and resolution-specific converted images into DynamoDB.
- If conversion fails:
  - The Lambda function will attempt to retry twice.
  - If still unsuccessful, it will log the failure and error message in DynamoDB.
  - Issues with the original image will already have been validated by the GitHub Action, so no additional checks will be performed at this stage.

## Implementation - Level 100
### OIDC(OpenID Connect)

- [About security hardening with OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
- [Create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html)

#### Overview
- There are several ways to access AWS resources from GitHub Actions, but one of the most common is using OIDC. (For more details, see the References section above)
- To configure OIDC, settings are required on both GitHub and AWS.

#### AWS IAM - Identity Provider
- Since the credentials must be handled externally (i.e., from GitHub), create an Identity Provider for this purpose.
- Configure Provider: `OpenID Connect`
- Provider URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`
- After creating the identify provider, Click assign role.

### AWS IAM - Role
- Trusted entity type: `Web Identity` (default)
- Select the audience
- Github Organization: organization or your account name
- Github Repository: a specific repository
- Github Branch: a specific repository (e.g. `main`)
- Add Permissions: `AmazonAPIGatewayInvokeFullAccess`

### Github Repository Settings
- Go `Secrets and variables` - `Actions`
- Secrets
  - `API_KEY`: your API Gateway's API key
- Variables
  - `AWS_IAM_ID`: your IAM ID
  - `AWS_INVOKE_ROLE`: The IAM Role you recently created
  - `AWS_RESOURCE_ID`: API Gateway Resource ID
  - `AWS_RES_API_ID`: API Gateway ID

### Github Action Setting
- Click `New Workflow` - `set up a workflow yourself`
- See the workflow: [Click](https://github.com/realworldismine/snail-images/blob/main/.github/workflows/api.yml)
- Ensure it only runs on push actions to the main branch.
- `actions/checkout@v4`
  - You must set `fetch-depth: 2`. Otherwise, issues will arise when comparing the previous commit’s HEAD later on.
- `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4`
  - Enter the ARN and region of the IAM Role you recently created.
  - It’s recommended to use Action Variables for the ARN instead of entering it directly.

### Github Action Shell Script
- The basic operation is as follows:
  - It compares the previous and current commits to check for changes, then processes only image files.
  - If a file in the commit is added, modified, or copied, it performs a PUT request.
  - If a file in the commit is deleted, it performs a DELETE request.
  - If a file in the commit is renamed, it first performs a DELETE request for the old name, then a PUT request for the new name.
  - For renames, similarity detection is used instead of a simple R, so it may appear as R100, R95, etc. The script should be set to run when the change type starts with R.
  - Since different content types are needed for different image extensions, ensure the correct content type is sent in the header during PUT requests.
  - PUT and DELETE requests use an API Key, so make sure the Action Secret contains the API Key value.
- The Operation is as follows.

### To-do Next
- In this level, we implemented the basic credentials and data transmission between GitHub Actions and AWS.
- In the next level, we will implement file name transformation and metadata storage and management using DynamoDB and Lambda functions.
